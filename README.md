ColorPalette
This project involves creating a ColorPalette of constant colors defined using the enum reference type. I used javaFX library to utilize the constant colors that I define in MyColor.java. I also used VBox, BorderPane, TilePane, and Pane to create the layout of the application. The left side of the layout consist of ColorPalette and the right side consist of canvas. When a user selects one of the colors from the color palette, the canvas is painted with the selected color and it displays the corresponding name in inverted color.
